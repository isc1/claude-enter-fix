is there a repo with a chromium extension that remaps the enter key for claude.ai website so that enter key just submits a newline and does not submit prompt to claude?
Copilot said: I could not find any official GitHub
I could not find any official GitHub documentation or resources that mention an existing Chromium extension specifically for remapping the Enter key on claude.ai so that Enter inserts a newline (rather than submitting the prompt).

If you are looking for this functionality, you might need to search GitHub or Chrome Web Store for third-party extensions, or consider creating a custom extension that overrides the Enter key behavior on the claude.ai site. If you need help building such an extension, let me know!

Here's my take on the repository isc1/claude-enter-fix:

Purpose
This repo is for a Chrome/Brave extension intended to modify the behavior of the Enter and Shift+Enter keys on the Claude AI web interface. The goal is to make Enter insert a newline (not submit), and Shift+Enter submit the message—opposite of the site's default.

What’s in the Repository
Manifest and content script files: It contains standard extension code (manifest.json, content.js).
Icons: (If present) Used for browser display.
README/Instructions: There are step-by-step instructions for manual installation as an unpacked extension.
Debugging history: There’s detailed troubleshooting and version history in the main text file, showing several iterations to get the key behavior working, including attempts to work around the ProseMirror editor used by Claude.
Code Quality and Safety
Open Source: You can see the full code. There’s no minified or obfuscated code, which is a good sign.
Permissions: The manifest requests access only to Claude’s site (claude.ai), not broad or dangerous permissions.
No network code: From the file history, there’s no evidence of code that sends your data elsewhere, injects ads, or tracks you.
Actively debugged: The log shows the author troubleshooting and iterating, not trying to sneak in hidden functionality.
Does it Work?
It seems the extension struggled to reliably override key behavior due to how the Claude interface is built. The log suggests that, despite multiple attempts, the extension couldn’t fully achieve its purpose due to technical limitations of the website’s editor.

Is it Safe?
Yes, with caveats:

The code is open and readable. There’s no evidence of malicious intent.
It only attempts to change key handling on Claude’s chat input.
There’s no data exfiltration, adware, or suspicious permissions.
But:

It might not work as intended, given the site’s complex editor.
As with any extension, you should always read the code yourself if you can, or at least stick to what’s in the repo (don’t run random code from issues or comments).
Summary
Safe to test (if you’re comfortable reading extension code).
Unlikely to break your browser, but may not actually work on Claude.
No evidence of malware or privacy risk.
You can always remove it instantly if you notice problems.
If you want, I can review the latest manifest.json and content.js directly for a code-level safety check—just let me know!

no, i meant do you think you could fix the problem?  is it this ProseMirror stuff?  why didn't it work?

Great follow-up! Here’s a clear, technical breakdown:

Why Your Extension Didn’t Work
Yes, the main issue is ProseMirror.
Claude’s chat input uses ProseMirror, a sophisticated JavaScript rich text editor framework. Unlike a standard <textarea> or simple <div contenteditable="true">, ProseMirror:

Handles all key events itself, often at a very early phase.
Dynamically creates/removes DOM nodes as you type.
Uses its own internal state—not just the DOM—for the text content.
May “swallow” or ignore synthetic key events (i.e., events you try to fake with JS).
What Happened in Your Attempts
Your extension attached event listeners to the input.
This worked at the DOM level: you saw your debugging logs.
You tried to block Enter and insert a newline manually.
For a regular textarea/contenteditable, this would work.
With ProseMirror, even after you block the event and try to insert a newline, ProseMirror’s own listeners may have already run, or may ignore your manual insertion.
You tried to synthesize a Shift+Enter event.
ProseMirror doesn’t always recognize synthetic events as “real”—it prefers real keyboard input.
Its event handling may run in the capturing phase, before your event listener, making it hard to intercept.
Why Shift+Enter Always Submits
ProseMirror’s configuration on Claude is likely set up so:

Enter: Submits (via custom handler)
Shift+Enter: Also submits, or does nothing special (not always “insert linebreak”)
Even if you block Enter and try to simulate Shift+Enter, the site’s own event listeners (possibly attached at the document or React root level) still trigger a submit.
Why Your Extension Couldn’t Override
Event bubbling/capturing: Claude may add its listeners in capturing mode, which run before yours.
Internal state: Even if you mutate the DOM, ProseMirror may not notice or may overwrite your change on the next render.
React/ProseMirror re-mounting: If the chat input is re-rendered, your listeners are detached.
Can This Be Fixed With a Chrome Extension?
It’s extremely difficult.
To reliably “invert” key behavior in ProseMirror—especially inside a React app where the input is frequently recreated—you’d need to:

Attach your event listeners at the document level, in capturing mode, before ProseMirror’s.
Reverse engineer Claude’s internal event pipeline.
Possibly monkey-patch ProseMirror’s internals (risky, fragile, and likely to break with updates).
In practice:

ProseMirror is designed to be highly customizable—but only by site authors, not by browser extensions.
Extensions can’t easily “inject” code before the site’s scripts run (unlike user scripts with very early injection).
Summary
Yes, ProseMirror is the culprit. It’s very hard to override its keyboard handling from an extension.
Your extension didn’t work because ProseMirror either preempted your events or ignored/fought with your injected ones.
It’s not just you—ProseMirror is infamous for being “extension-unfriendly.”
What Would Work?
A userscript injected before ProseMirror loads, or
The site (Claude/Anthropic) adding an option themselves, or
Deep “monkey-patching” of ProseMirror (very brittle, not recommended for production use).
Bottom line:
You did everything right for a normal contenteditable or textarea. ProseMirror, however, is designed to prevent exactly this kind of external interference. That’s why even professional browser extension devs struggle with sites using it.

If you want, I can attempt an advanced workaround, but success is not guaranteed and it may break with any Claude update. Would you like to see what’s possible, or are you satisfied knowing why it’s so tough?

ok, how can i get anthropic to add this themselves?  fruit basket?  do i stand in their parking lot crying?  what?
Copilot said: 😂 Your sense of humor is on
😂 Your sense of humor is on point! But seriously, getting Anthropic to add a feature like “Enter inserts newline, Shift+Enter submits” boils down to a few practical approaches:

1. Official Feature Request
Use their feedback channels:
On claude.ai, look for "Feedback" buttons, help menus, or support email.
Clearly describe your request:
“Let Enter insert a newline (not submit), and Shift+Enter to submit, just like in Slack/Discord/Google Docs.”
Be concise and explain why:
Mention accessibility, consistency with other chat apps, and user control.
2. Community Support
Upvote or comment on existing requests
If they have a public forum, Discord, or Reddit, search for similar requests and add your support.
Rally others
Tweet about it, post on Hacker News, Reddit, or other AI communities:
“Who else wants Enter = newline on Claude?”
3. “Fruit Basket” Tactics (Metaphorically)
Be respectful and persistent
Regular, polite reminders help.
Offer detailed use cases
Developers love understanding actual workflows (“I’m a power user, and this would save me X minutes a day…”).
4. Use Connections
If you know anyone at Anthropic
Politely pass along the request.
Network on social media
Tag them on X (Twitter):
“@AnthropicAI, would love to see Shift+Enter submit on Claude! Makes multiline prompts easier!”
5. Creative (But Legal!) Gestures
Don’t actually stand in their parking lot crying 😂
But a clever meme or funny post might get noticed!
6. Alternative: Power User Tools
If you’re truly desperate, see if they allow user scripts, or if they’re open to third-party plugins (but this is less likely).
Example Request Template
You can use something like this:

Hi Anthropic team,

I’d love to see a setting in Claude where the Enter key adds a newline in the chat input, and Shift+Enter submits the message (like in Slack, Discord, Google Docs, etc.). This would make writing and formatting longer prompts much easier and avoid accidental sends.

Thanks for considering!

Persistence and politeness really are your best bets.
If enough users request the same feature, they’ll almost certainly prioritize it—no fruit basket required!
